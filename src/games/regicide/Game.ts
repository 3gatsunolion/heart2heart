The players win when the last King is defeated. But beware! Each turn the enemy strikes back. Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can\'t discard enough, everyone loses.\n\nRich with tactical decisions and a deep heuristic tree, **Regicide** is a huge challenge for anyone who is brave enough to take it on!',
