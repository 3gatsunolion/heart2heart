### Gameplay
The rules are simple. Each turn, players have two options:
- play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card
- pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card

![No Thanks! Turn Options](https://github.com/3gatsunolion/heart2heart/blob/master/assets/nothanks/demo/no-thanks-turn-options.gif)

The choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the **lowest score** at the end of the game. The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value. Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors. Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.

Once all 24 cards have found its owner, the player with the lowest final score wins!

<h2 id="regicide">Regicide</h2>

<a href="https://www.badgersfrommars.com/regicide">Regicide</a> is a cooperative, fantasy card game for 1 to 4 players, played using a standard deck of cards. Players work together to defeat the 12 corrupted monarchs.

### Commands
- Use command `?regicide` to create a new game of **Regicide**.

![Create a new game of Regicide](https://github.com/3gatsunolion/heart2heart/blob/master/assets/regicide/demo/regicide-create-game.gif)
- Use command `?regicide end` to end the game.

### Gameplay
Players take turns to play cards to attack the enemy. Playing a card (or cards) to damage the enemy also grants a power associated with the suit of that card. Once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated.

But beware! Each turn the enemy strikes back. Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can't discard enough, everyone loses.

The players win when the last King is defeated.

Rich with tactical decisions and a deep heuristic tree, **Regicide** is a huge challenge for anyone who is brave enough to take it on! A comprehensive rule guide to the game can be found <a href="https://www.badgersfrommars.com/assets/RegicideRulesA4.pdf">here</a>.
